I’m currently a pre-final year BTech student in Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT), and my journey in the world of coding and design has been both exciting and rewarding.</p>

<h3>My Journey:</h3>
<p>
I always loved drawing as my hobby. My curiosity about how websites and apps were built led me to explore HTML, CSS, and graphic designing tools like Canva and IbisPaint X.
Through this my interest also started developing in UI/UX designing so I also learned how Figma works.
</p>

<h3>Foundational Learning:</h3>
<p>
During my first year of BTech, I focused on building a strong foundation in programming, learning languages such as C, C++ and Python. At the same time, I honed my design skills by creating digital planners. I also learned about Notion which has helped me in many ways throughout planning my learning.

{/* <h3>Projects & Hands-on Experience:</h3>
<p>
By my second year, I started integrating coding with design. I built projects like:

<li>Hello Kitty-themed planner desktop app using HTML, CSS, and Electron.js.</li>

<li>Solar system simulation using HTML and CSS animations.</li>

<li>Tic-Tac-Toe game while learning JS.</li>

<h3>Exploring Web Development:</h3>
<p>
I gradually dove into JavaScript, React, and full-stack web development. 
<br></br>
Now, in my 4th year, I’m sharpening my skills in UI/UX design, frontend development and AI/ML basics. I aim to create intuitive and aesthetically pleasing digital experiences.
